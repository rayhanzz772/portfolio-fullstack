    description: "SoilAI is a research-based project that explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence in analyzing soil health and characteristics. The system is designed to assist farmers, researchers, and agricultural stakeholders in making data-driven decisions by automating the identification of soil conditions through image recognition and sensor data. The proposed solution leverages AI algorithms—such as machine learning and deep learning—to classify soil types, predict nutrient levels, and detect early signs of degradation or imbalance. Data is collected through IoT-based soil sensors and/or mobile imaging, which are then processed to generate real-time insights and recommendations for optimal crop planning and sustainable land management.",
